### Key Features:

1. Add, Search, and Remove Words: Users can add new words, search for existing ones, and remove words from the Trie.

2. Prefix and Suffix Search: The application allows users to search for words based on prefixes and suffixes.

3. Web Interface: Built with Flask, the web interface enables users to:

   - Check if a word exists in the Trie.
   - Perform auto-complete searches by prefix.
   - Delete words from the Trie.
   - Upload new word lists from files.

4. Session Management: Users can manage word lists in the session, ensuring the app retains changes across interactions.

5. Testing: Unit tests validate the functionality of the Trie and its operations, including error handling for missing words.

Trie Dictionary Manager provides an efficient and scalable way to work with large sets of words, making it a practical tool for dictionary management and word search applications.
