            The Trie Dictionary Manager is an efficient tool for managing words in a dictionary-like structure. Using a
            Trie (prefix tree) data structure, it allows for quick insertion, deletion, and search operations. The app
            provides users with the ability to check if words exist, find words with common prefixes, and remove words
            from the dictionary. Its primary goal is to make word management seamless and optimized for performance.

            Perfect for applications that require fast and reliable word storage, retrieval, and manipulation, the Trie
            Dictionary Manager ensures high efficiency, especially when dealing with large datasets.
